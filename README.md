# Brick Breaker

This repository contains the source code for a simulation of Brick Breaker (1999) implemented entirely in Assembly Language (x86) using Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) alongside Irvine. This project was completed as part of the project for the Computer Organisation & Assembly Language (EE2003) course.

## Introduction

Brick Breaker is a classic arcade platformer where players control a paddle to deflect a bouncing ball and break through a wall of bricks. The goal is to clear all the bricks to advance to the next level. The game features increasing difficulty and hidden elements in the final stage.

### Gameplay

- **Objective**: Destroy all bricks to advance to the next level. The game ends if all lives are lost.
- **Lives**: Start with three lives. A life is lost if the ball falls below the bottom of the screen.
- **Levels**: 
  - **Level 1 & 2**: Feature visible bricks arranged in various patterns.
  - **Level 3**: Includes invisible bricks that deflect the ball unpredictably.

## Features

- **Paddle Control**: Move the paddle horizontally using keyboard controls.
- **Ball Mechanics**: The ball bounces off the paddle and bricks, with its trajectory affected by collisions.
- **Level Progression**: Advance through levels by clearing all bricks. Each level presents a new challenge.
- **Scoring and Lives**: Track your score and remaining lives during gameplay.

## Build Instructions

1. **Setup MASM & Irvine**: Ensure Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) is installed on your system.
2. **Assemble and Link**: Use MASM to assemble and link the source code files and give a path for Irvine.
3. **Run the Game**: Execute the resulting binary file to start playing.

## Usage

- **Control the Paddle**: Use the specified keys to move the paddle left and right.
- **Deflect the Ball**: Bounce the ball off the paddle to hit and destroy the bricks.
- **Advance Levels**: Clear all bricks to proceed to the next level.
